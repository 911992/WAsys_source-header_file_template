Copy paste the template, find and replace the following with appreciated value

In header file:
<<^^__WAsys_FILE_NAME__>> change to the file name(without extension), e.g. my_app
<<^^__WAsys_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP__>> change to current timestamp/date-time with desired format
<<^^__WAsys_DEV__>> change to your name

In source file:
<<^^__WAsys_FILE_NAME__>> change to the file name(without extension), e.g. my_app
<<^^__WAsys_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP__>> change to current timestamp/date-time with desired format
<<^^__WAsys_DEV__>> change to your name

Mind in source code, it includes a header name with same source file name(after replacing)
